# Individual Logbook

## Feedback on Individual Logbook (#1)
Asked my coach Lamia if the logbook looks like how she expects it to be. Also asked if I had to fill in the other letters of the STARRT.

Updated my online repo by adding the "T", "A" and "R" to "STARRT - Intake"

## Feedback on Individual Logbook during midterm meeting (#2)
Asked feedback on my individual logbook during the midterm meeting.
| Learning Outcome | Feedback | Grading |
|------------------|-----------|----------|
| D1 | (13/10/2025) - Some evidences are not present in "Activiteiten & Leeruitkomsten" think of: Ontwerpreview, PvA, Symposium Presentation. Midterm STARRT is not present. Feedback is lacking the feedback of CMD students. Finally, Lamia also told me we should consider discussing what we want to do in iteration 2 within the group project. | - |

I decided to add the missing evidences to "Activiteiten & Leeruitkomsten". I also added the midterm STARRT reflection. I decided not to add the cmd student feedback, since that feedback belongs to my group project feedback collection. Also did I tell me group we should consider planning a meeting on what we want to do for iteration 2. I realised alot of individual feedback is missing from "Feedback" so i will make sure all the feedback is there

## Feedback and Grading on Individual Logbook (#3)
On the 30th of October 2025 I delivered my first version of the individual logbook and on the 31st I delivered my final version. The 11th of November I received feedback from my personal coach Lamia.

| D1 | (11/11/2025) - Hello Kaan<br>Thank you for submitting your logbook.<br>It is very well organized and shows how much effort you have put into documenting your work and keeping track of progress and feedback.<br>I also appreciate how you take ownership of group coordination (leading meetings, maintaining notes, and following up on feedback show strong initiative and reliability)<br>What could make your reflection stronger is going beyond what happened and focusing more on what you have learned about yourself.<br>For instance, when you mention that self-study works better for you, what does that tell you about your motivation, focus, or preferred learning environment? How are you now adaption to the new structure, how are you adapting your learning activities and what works for you?<br>For the last part of your logbook, I expected to see a few more concrete insights about what you are taking with you into the next block, even though the current block has not officially ended yet.<br>Regards,<br>Lamia | Op niveau |

I noticed that I didn't deliver the latest version. So I delivered a version without Conclusions and Insights and without any styling. Since block 1 and 2 should be documented in the same logbook, I will go back to the logbook and add the missing paragraph Lamia mentioned.
