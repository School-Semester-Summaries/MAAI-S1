# MAAI Bootcamp :: Python Environments

## Introduction

Here we learn how to prepare a basic development environment for the bootcamp. 

It is expected that, in the end, you:
- Have python installed 
- Can create, activate and use environments
- Can manage packages within an environment
- Can use an environment within an IDE such as VS Code

## Tutorial

- Access the tutorial from [this link](https://gitlab.fdmci.hva.nl/maai/python-environment)

## Activity

You should prepare your development environment to follow the next part of the bootcamp

Instructions:

1. Installation:
    1. Install Python if not present in your local computer (see [tutorial](https://gitlab.fdmci.hva.nl/maai/python-environment))
    2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Cloning the project
    1. You should open your command line interface and move to the folder you want to download/clone the project. Run the command `git clone git@gitlab.fdmci.hva.nl:maai/maai-bootcamp.git`
3. Python Environment
    1. Move to the `maai-bootcamp/d1` folder
    2. Create an environment for this exercise
    2. Activate the environment
    3. Install the packages from the `requirements.txt` file
4. Testing the environment
    1. Open this project using Visual Studio Code
    2. Activate the created environment
    3. Open the Jupyter File `d1/day1-p3.ipynb` and try to execute some Python cells
