    "## About the Dataset and Prediction Task \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll work with the [Adult Census Income dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income), which is commonly used in machine learning literature. This data was extracted from the [1994 Census bureau database](http://www.census.gov/en.html) by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example in the dataset contains the following demographic data for a set of individuals who took part in the 1994 Census:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Features\n",
    "*   `age`: The age of the individual in years.\n",
    "*   `fnlwgt`: The number of individuals the Census Organizations believes that set of observations represents.\n",
    "*   `education_num`:  An enumeration of the categorical representation of education. The higher the number, the higher the education that individual achieved. For example, an `education_num` of `11` represents `Assoc_voc` (associate degree at a vocational school), an `education_num` of `13` represents `Bachelors`, and an `education_num` of `9` represents `HS-grad` (high school graduate).\n",
    "*   `capital_gain`: Capital gain made by the individual, represented in US Dollars.\n",
    "*   `capital_loss`: Capital loss made by the individual, represented in US Dollars.\n",
    "*   `hours_per_week`: Hours worked per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical Features\n",
    "*   `workclass`: The individual's type of employer. Examples include: `Private`, `Self-emp-not-inc`, `Self-emp-inc`, `Federal-gov`, `Local-gov`, `State-gov`, `Without-pay`, and `Never-worked`.\n",
    "*   `education`: The highest level of education achieved for that individual.\n",
    "*   `marital_status`: Marital status of the individual. Examples include: `Married-civ-spouse`, `Divorced`, `Never-married`, `Separated`, `Widowed`, `Married-spouse-absent`, and `Married-AF-spouse`.\n",
    "*   `occupation`: The occupation of the individual. Example include: `tech-support`, `Craft-repair`, `Other-service`, `Sales`, `Exec-managerial` and more.\n",
    "*   `relationship`:  The relationship of each individual in a household. Examples include: `Wife`, `Own-child`, `Husband`, `Not-in-family`, `Other-relative`, and `Unmarried`.\n",
    "*   `gender`:  Gender of the individual available only in binary choices: `Female` or `Male`.\n",
    "*   `race`: `White`, `Asian-Pac-Islander`, `Amer-Indian-Eskimo`, `Black`, and `Other`.\n",
    "*   `native_country`: Country of origin of the individual. Examples include: `United-States`, `Cambodia`, `England`, `Puerto-Rico`, `Canada`, `Germany`, `Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc)`, `India`, `Japan`, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction Task\n",
    "The prediction task is to **determine whether a person makes over $50,000 US Dollar a year.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Label\n",
    "*   `income_bracket`: Whether the person makes more than $50,000 US Dollars annually.\n",

    "\n",
    "All the examples extracted for this dataset meet the following conditions:\n",
    "*   `age` is 16 years or older.\n",
    "*   The adjusted gross income (used to calculate `income_bracket`) is greater than $100 USD annually.\n",
    "*   `fnlwgt` is greater than 0.\n",
