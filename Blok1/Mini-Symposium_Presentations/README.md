## PvA Presentation
On the 3rd of October I presented my PvA to Marcio and directly after received my feedback on DLO.

| Learning Outcome | Feedback | Grading |
|------------------|-----------|----------|
| D1 / D2 | • You presented in less than 3 minutes, whereas the amount of time was 10 minutes.<br>• You should give better definitions of some terms, like Model Types.<br>• Research questions should be more specific towards one technique or another <br>• The problem you chose is around the disparity of data between males and females | Hier is nog werk nodig / Hier is nog werk nodig |

I disagree with the first point. Yes, it was very short, but we weren't informed how long the presentation was ment to be. I scaled down the research drastically, and made all the unclarities clear (the PvA was a collection of vagueness).

## Poster Presentation

On the 6th of November I presented my poster to Lamia Elloumi and on the 7th of november I received an update: a comment on my poster presentation and an upgraded grade.

| D2 | Thank you for your poster presentation. Your presentation was fine, and as you noted there were few mistakes in your poster.<br>We are upgrading D2 from onder niveau to op niveau.| Op Niveau |

Partially agree since there was only one mistake in the poster. But I am satisfied with the grade.
