# MAAI Bootcamp

## Bootcamp

This exercise is part of the bootcamp of the Master of Applied AI of HvA. It explores a small subset of ideas and techniques relevant to ML problem framing.

## Prerequisites

This repository contains a set of jupyter notebooks with a mix of theory, examples and exercises. We strongly recommend you run it from your local computer. The used datasets are rather small and do not require intense computing. As such, you can configure and validate if you have the necessary tools, such as the Python runtime, IDEs and git.

## Jupyter notebooks

The following Jupyter notebooks are available:

- [day1-p1.MD](day1-p1.MD): Covers the tutorial on Python environments (includes an activity)
- [day1-p2.ipynb](day1-p2.ipynb): Contains a brief overview of ML
- [day1-p3.ipynb](day1-p3.ipynb): Contains an example of an end-to-end ML use case
- [day1-p4.ipynb](day1-p4.ipynb): The activity of the day
