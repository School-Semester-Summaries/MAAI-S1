    "Here we recapitulate the fundamentals concepts of machine learning and used jargons you should know by heart. This section is based on chapter 3 of the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition 2022* by Aurélien Géron, and many code snippets, explanations and illustrations were used. Some changes were made to accommodate the subject within the MAAI bootcamp's timeframe. The book is a relevant source for a recap, and it is available in the [HvA Library](https://bib.hva.nl).\n",

    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig in the book \"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\", Machine Learning is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the construction and study of systems that can learn from data\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ML programs uses a set of examples for learning purposes, called *the training set*. This set contains *training examples* or *training instances*\n",
    "- The part that makes predictions is called a *model*. Neural networks and random forests are examples of models\n",
    "- Metrics can be used to evaluate the performance of the model. For example, the performance of a spam classifier can be measured by the ratio of correctly classified emails. This metric is called *accuracy*"

    "\n",
    "Machine learning is great for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules (a machine learning model can often simplify code and perform better than the traditional approach)\n",
    "- Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yields no good solution (the best machine learning techniques can perhaps find a solution)\n",
    "- Fluctuating environments (a machine learning system can easily be retrained on new data, always keeping it up to date)\n",
    "- Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data\n",

    "- Text Generation: Creating human-like text (e.g., GPT generating essays, articles, or code).\n",
    "- Image/Video Generation: Producing images/videos from textual descriptions\n",
    "- Style Transfer: Applying artistic styles to images (e.g., turning a photo into a painting).\n",
    "- Music Composition: Creating original music compositions based on certain styles or inputs.\n",
    "- Data Augmentation: Generating additional training data, such as synthetic images for machine learning.\n",
    "- 3D Model Generation: Creating 3D models from 2D images or sketches.\n",
