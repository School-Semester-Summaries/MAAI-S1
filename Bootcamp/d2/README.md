# MAAI Bootcamp

## Bootcamp

This exercise is part of the bootcamp of the Master of Applied AI of HvA. It explores a small subset of ideas and techniques relevant to ML problem framing.

## Prerequisites

This repository contains a set of jupyter notebooks with a mix of theory, examples and exercises. We strongly recommend you run it from your local computer. The used datasets are rather small and do not require intense computing. As such, you can configure and validate if you have the necessary tools, such as the Python runtime, IDEs and git.

## Cloning this project

You should open your command line interface and move to the folder you want to download/clone the project.

```
git clone git@gitlab.fdmci.hva.nl:maai/maai-bootcamp.git

## Jupyter notebooks

The following Jupyter notebooks are available:

- [day2-p1.MD](day2-p1.MD): Git Basics (it includes an activity)
- [day2-p2.ipynb](day2-p2.ipynb): ML Evaluation
- [day2-p3.ipynb](day2-p3.ipynb): The activity of the day
